## This Is Not QEMU

</p>

That is a real laptop. The desktop — compositor, terminal, file manager,
system monitor, image viewer — is drawn by our own Intel Xe display driver.
The keyboard and I²C-HID touchpad were discovered by walking the firmware's
actual AML tables with our own ACPI interpreter, then driven over our own
I²C and GPIO drivers. The slop has escaped the sandbox.

## Get It Running

> **You need:** QEMU, xorriso, e2fsprogs, [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) — plus Go ≥ 1.22 if you want `just test`

```bash
# macOS
brew install qemu xorriso e2fsprogs just go

# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install qemu-system-x86 xorriso e2fsprogs golang
cargo install just  # or: https://github.com/casey/just#installation

# Arch (btw)
sudo pacman -S qemu-full xorriso e2fsprogs just go

# Then:
just setup          # installs the pinned rust nightly + the forked `slopos` sysroot
just boot           # spins the wheel
```

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `just boot` | Boot with a display window |
| `just boot-fast` | Skip the Wheel of Fate (coward) |
| `just boot-headless` | Serial only, no window |
| `just test` | Run the 2,500+ test suite under QEMU |
| `just --list` | Everything else (there's a lot) |

When it wedges, ask it why: press **SysRq** (Alt+PrintScreen) — or send a
**BREAK** on the serial line — then a command key. `h` lists them; `t` dumps
every task with a symbolized park site. Only the physical console can trigger
it, and `kconsole=off` on the kernel cmdline turns it off entirely.

<summary><b>Advanced knobs</b></summary>

```bash
QEMU_DISPLAY=cocoa just boot                       # force a display backend (macOS auto-detects Cocoa)
QEMU_FB_WIDTH=2560 QEMU_FB_HEIGHT=1440 just boot   # manual framebuffer override
just ports=7777,8080 boot                          # expose guest ports on the host
just test 'mm::*'                                  # run a subset of the tests
just boot-debug                                    # QEMU GDB stub on :1234
```

## What's In The Slop

Everything below is `#![no_std]` Rust written for this kernel — no smoltcp,
no borrowed driver crates. When we say the wizards wrote a TCP stack, we
mean the wizards wrote a TCP stack.

**Kernel** — SMP preemptive scheduler, buddy allocator with demand paging
and copy-on-write fork, SYSCALL/SYSRET fast path, LAPIC/IOAPIC + MSI-X
interrupts, futexes, signals, pipes, ppoll, PTYs, process groups, signalfd,
pidfd. A panic gets caught, its backtrace symbolized, and the damage billed
to the offending task's oops ledger — the machine keeps going.

**Drivers** — Intel Xe display (the one in the photo), virtio-gpu/blk/net,
i8042 keyboard with live layout switching (the Swiss QWERTZ in the photo
types its dead keys correctly), and an I²C-HID touchpad sitting on our own
DesignWare I²C and Intel GPIO drivers, wired up by our own ACPI/AML
interpreter.

**Network** — a from-scratch TCP/IP stack: ARP, IPv4, TCP, UDP, ICMP, DHCP,
DNS, unix sockets, NAPI-style ingress. Userland ships `curl`, `ping`, `nc`,
and — for auditing your own two sockets — `nmap`.

**Desktop** — a compositor with damage tracking and occlusion culling,
clients passing buffers over memfd + SCM_RIGHTS (the Wayland trick), an
appkit widget toolkit that draws proportional UI text beside a fixed-cell code
surface, and apps: terminal (with scrollback reflow), a code editor with a file
tree, syntax highlighting and a command palette, file manager, image viewer,
system monitor.

**Plumbing** — our own libc (`slibc`) with an mmap-only malloc, an
io_uring-style submission ring (SlopRing), a VFS with ext2, devfs, ramfs,
and an initramfs RAM root that boots with no disk attached at all.

**The economy** — the Wheel of Fate gates every boot, and outcomes accrue
to your W/L balance. The only operating system with a load-bearing gambling
mechanic.

## Actually, The Slop Is Proven

Under the goofy exterior, SlopOS is a **framekernel**: every line of
`unsafe` in the entire kernel is authored in one trusted crate,
`slopos-ostd`. Every other kernel crate is `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, and
because a macro from another crate can expand `unsafe` past that lint
without a diagnostic, CI also **expands every kernel crate and reads what
the compiler actually saw** — zero executable `unsafe`, and `unsafe impl` /
`link_section` / `no_mangle` only from a named list with a reason attached
to each. Alongside it, gates inspect the final ELF: no stack frame over
2 KiB, no SSE instruction anywhere in the kernel, every linker registry
holding whole entries.

The number worth defending is not the keyword count — folding `unsafe`
behind a safe wrapper is the design, not a cheat. It is how much of OSTD's
API you have to trust by reading rather than by type-checking: **54
`pub unsafe fn`, 15 `pub unsafe trait`, and 16 safe functions that still
carry a prose contract**, the last of which is ratcheted downward and
cannot grow without CI noticing. `just tcb-ratio` reports the older
unsafe-line-density figure (0.52 %) — useful as a trend, not comparable to
other projects' TCB fractions, which are measured differently.

The load-bearing invariants of that core are **machine-checked with
[Verus](https://github.com/verus-lang/verus)**, an SMT-backed proof system
for Rust. The proofs cover the spots where a bug would be genuine undefined
behaviour rather than a typed error:

- **Frame reference counts** — no double-free, no use-after-free.
- **Slab slot lifetimes** — a slot can never outlive the slab it came from.
- **Page-table mutation** — every walk stays well-formed; user mappings
  can't reach into sensitive kernel memory.
- **SlopRing cursors & buffer pool** — a hostile userland can't overwrite
  or overflow the shared rings.
- **TCP zero-copy pinning** — a page stays pinned as long as the NIC might
  still read it.

The proofs run in CI on every change and reproduce locally with
`just verify`. For everything they don't cover: 2,500+ tests boot under
QEMU on every change (`just test`), the trusted core runs under Miri
(`just check-miri`), and when a bug only reproduces on Tuesdays, there's
deterministic time-travel debugging (`just rr-record` / `just rr-replay`).

## The Wizards Invented None Of This

Nobody thinks up demand paging on a beach. Every genuinely hard problem in this
repo — paging, preemption, wake races, TLB coherence, TCP over a network that
hates you — was solved decades before we got here by people who wrote it down
and gave it away. The wizards washed up on Sloptopia with no operating system
and a spectacularly well-stocked library. **We studied and reimplemented. We
did not copy.** The ideas are theirs; only the slop is ours.

**[Asterinas](https://github.com/asterinas/asterinas)** — the shape of this
entire kernel. The **framekernel** thesis is theirs: one trusted crate owns
every line of `unsafe`, everything else is `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, and your
TCB size is a number you are expected to defend in public. So is the name
`slopos-ostd`, the vocabulary our memory manager speaks all day (`MetaSlot`,
`Frame<M>`, `VmSpace` + cursors, `derive(Pod)`), and the 2 KiB stack ceiling CI
fails builds over — Inv. 5′, out of §4.3 of [their ATC '25
paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03876). Their KernMiri and
[vostd](https://github.com/asterinas/vostd) work is why we believed the proofs
above were worth attempting rather than merely hoping at.

**[Linux](https://kernel.org)** — the largest debt by a distance. The errnos,
signals, termios and `io_uring` ABI are the obvious part. The rest is everything
we only got right because Linux got there first: `try_to_wake_up`'s totality
discipline, the 16-slot PCID scheme from `arch/x86/mm/tlb.c`, `call_rcu`,
lockdep, the `n_tty` line discipline, the VFS shape, the CSPRNG from
`drivers/char/random.c`, NAPI ingress, and a TCP stack that inherited its timers
from thirty years of other people's outages. Our tests speak KTAP; our stack
gate is `CONFIG_FRAME_WARN` with the warning promoted to a build failure.

**[Redox](https://www.redox-os.org)** — how a Rust OS models an address space
without `unsafe`: a `BTreeMap` of regions with enum backings, which is what our
VMA layer still is. Also the per-CPU control region, the PS/2 init sequence, and
the standing proof that a from-scratch Rust OS is a thing people actually
finish — load-bearing knowledge when your kernel has failed to boot nine times
in an evening.

**Also read closely, each for something specific** —
[CortenMM](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~tamir/papers/sosp25.pdf) (SOSP '25 best
paper) for the page-table cursor and the invariants our proof discharges;
[Fuchsia](https://fuchsia.dev) for SafeStack's pinned per-thread TLS offsets;
[FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org) for WITNESS lock-order checking and
`stop_cpus_hard`; [illumos](https://illumos.org) for `cv_wait_sig`'s return
semantics; [seL4](https://sel4.systems) for the queued-bit discipline and the
older idea that an invariant is a thing you *prove*;
[Rust for Linux](https://rust-for-linux.com) for `Opaque<T>`, and for
`pin-init`, read very closely before we wrote our own `Init<T, E>`;
[musl](https://musl.libc.org) for the `__init_tls` auxv walk; and
[smoltcp](https://github.com/smoltcp-rs/smoltcp) — still not a dependency, as
advertised above — which settled typestate vs. enum for our TCP sockets.

**Standards and tools** — [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org) (the memfd
+ `SCM_RIGHTS` buffer handoff is libwayland's trick), POSIX, VirtIO, the ext2
on-disk format, a couple dozen IETF RFCs, VT100/xterm escapes, ACPI, UEFI and
the Intel SDM; built and checked with
[Limine](https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine),
[QEMU](https://www.qemu.org), OVMF,
[Verus](https://github.com/verus-lang/verus), Miri,
[rr](https://rr-project.org), [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) and Go —
and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), without which this project's entire
security argument, *the compiler won't let us*, would just be a wish.

And the honest one, because leaving it out would be cowardly: SlopOS was built
with an enormous amount of AI assistance, and the models doing that writing
learned how kernels work by reading the projects credited above. When a model
hands the wizards a wake path with the right totality argument, that is not
magic — that is someone having gotten it right in public, years ago, at length.
Same debt as always. It just arrives faster now.
