## Authorship and provenance

SlopOS is developed with heavy use of AI coding assistants under continuous
human direction, architecture, review, integration, debugging, and
modification. Copyright is claimed in the human-authored expression and in the
selection, coordination, and arrangement of the work as a whole.

No code was copied from any other kernel or operating system. Where in-tree
comments name other systems — Linux, Asterinas, Redox, CortenMM, Fuchsia,
FreeBSD, illumos, seL4, Rust for Linux, musl, dlmalloc, smoltcp and others —
they identify **conceptual influence, published specifications, or ABI
compatibility targets**, not copied source. Interface constants (syscall
numbers, `errno` values, ioctl codes, struct layouts, hardware register
offsets) are reproduced where compatibility requires it; those are interface
facts rather than authorship.

## Modified Rust standard library

SlopOS builds against a modified copy of the Rust standard library. Files under
`library/std/src/sys` are patched at build time by `scripts/patch_std.sh` to add
the `slopos` target platform-abstraction layer. Those modifications are
© 2025–2026 The SlopOS Authors and are licensed GPL-3.0-or-later; the
unmodified Rust standard library is © The Rust Project Contributors under
`MIT OR Apache-2.0`.

## Components linked into SlopOS binaries

Each component below is dual-licensed `MIT OR Apache-2.0` unless noted. **SlopOS
elects the MIT option** for all of them. The MIT permission notice is reproduced
once at the end of this section and applies to every entry.

`gimli` and `unwinding` are vendored verbatim under [`vendor/`](vendor/); each
directory retains its upstream `LICENSE-MIT` and `LICENSE-APACHE`.

`libm` 0.2.16 is licensed **MIT only** — no Apache option is available — and
carries these copyrights, retained from its own `LICENSE.txt`:

Portions of `libm` derive from musl libc (<https://www.musl-libc.org/>),
which carries `Copyright © 2005-2020 Rich Felker, et al.`, and from the
CORE-MATH project. musl's own notice records that much of the math library code
is `Copyright © 1993,2004 Sun Microsystems`, `© 2003-2011 David Schultz`,
`© 2003-2009 Steven G. Kargl`, `© 2003-2009 Bruce D. Evans`, `© 2008 Stephen

## Components distributed on the SlopOS ISO

### Limine bootloader

`limine-bios.sys`, `limine-bios-cd.bin`, `limine-uefi-cd.bin`, `BOOTX64.EFI` and
`BOOTIA32.EFI` are distributed on the SlopOS ISO. Limine is a separate and
independent work aggregated onto the same medium; its inclusion does not place
it under the GNU GPL, and the GPL does not apply to it.

### Fonts

Both families are shipped unmodified as `.ttf` files in `/usr/share/fonts/`,
bundled alongside SlopOS rather than merged into it. Neither declares a Reserved
Font Name. Each family's full SIL Open Font License 1.1 text travels with it, in
[`assets/fonts/`](assets/fonts/) and on the installed images, and covers every
weight of that family shipped beside it.

- **Inter** (Regular, SemiBold) — `Copyright (c) 2016 The Inter Project Authors
  (https://github.com/rsms/inter)` — SIL OFL 1.1, full text in
  [`assets/fonts/Inter-OFL.txt`](assets/fonts/Inter-OFL.txt)
- **JetBrains Mono** (Regular, Bold) — `Copyright 2020 The JetBrains Mono
  Project Authors (https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono)` — SIL OFL 1.1,

## Host tooling — not distributed with SlopOS

QEMU, OVMF / EDK II, Verus and Z3, Miri, rr, `just`, and the Go toolchain
(including `golang.org/x/term` and `golang.org/x/sys`) are used to build, run,
verify and test SlopOS. None of their code is incorporated into SlopOS or
distributed with it, and their licenses impose no terms on SlopOS output.

## Trademarks

Linux® is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds. seL4® is a trademark of
LF Projects, LLC. FreeBSD is a registered trademark of The FreeBSD Foundation.
Fuchsia is a trademark of Google LLC. All other names are the property of their
respective owners.

Use of these names is nominative — they identify the projects they belong to and
nothing else. SlopOS is an independent, from-scratch operating system. It is not
affiliated with, endorsed by, sponsored by, or derived from any project named
