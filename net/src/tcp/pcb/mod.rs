//! Process control block — the state machine each TCP connection lives
//! inside.
//!
//! Every active connection owns one [`Pcb`]: a common header plus a
//! variant-sized [`PcbState`] payload, with each per-state handler in its own
//! submodule and this module holding the `Pcb::on_segment` dispatcher.
//!
//! Transitions mutate `self.state` in place rather than consuming `self`, so
//! `PcbTable` can keep a `Pcb` where it sits in its
//! `[Option<Pcb>; MAX_CONNECTIONS]` slot with no `take()`/put-back dance.
