//! Network device abstraction: `NetDevice` trait, device registry, and stable device handles.
//!
//! The boundary between network drivers (which move bytes) and the protocol
//! stack (which understands protocols). Only [`PacketBuf`] crosses it.
//!
//! The registry lock serializes registration/unregistration/enumeration. The
//! data plane bypasses the registry entirely via [`DeviceHandle`]: `tx()`
//! acquires a per-device lock, `poll_rx()` requires none (single consumer, the
//! NAPI loop).
//!
//! All trait methods take `&self`; implementations use interior mutability for
//! their internal state, which is what allows concurrent TX and RX without
//! aliasing `&mut` references.
