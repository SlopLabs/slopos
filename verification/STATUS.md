# OSTD Verification Status

The coverage map for the trusted core. `just verify` proves the proofs that
*exist*; this file is the honest record of what is and isn't covered — the
negative space the gate can't tell you about.

- **Pinned Verus**: `0.2026.05.24.ecee80a`
  (commit `ecee80a2139923d503338e6989f79fb690ec7847`) — see `verus.toml`.
- **Status legend**:
  - **verified** — a Verus proof in `proofs/` machine-checks the module's
    load-bearing invariants on the pinned toolchain.
  - **audited only** — manually reviewed against the soundness invariants
    and covered by KernMiri (`just check-miri`) + `// SAFETY:` annotations
    (every `unsafe` block names ≥1 of Inv. 1–10); no machine-checked proof.
  - **unaudited** — pure safe Rust, no `unsafe`; sound by the type system,
    no Inv. obligation.

## Coverage map

### Verified

The OSTD memory-safety critical path: the three places a bug would be UB
rather than a typed error. Per-obligation detail lives in each proof file's
own doc-comments — not duplicated here.

| Module | Proof file | Proves |
|---|---|---|
| `slopos_ostd::mm::frame` | `proofs/frame_refcount.rs` | `Frame<M>` ref-count: no double-free, no use-after-free, `ref_count > 0` ⇒ allocated, free-listed ⇒ slot reset-before-free (I1–I4) |
| `slopos_ostd::mm::slab` | `proofs/slab_lifetime.rs` | `HeapSlot` lifetime: a slot can't outlive its slab (Inv. 9); a cell fits any in-range type (Inv. 10) |
| `slopos_ostd::mm::vm_space` | `proofs/vm_space_cursor.rs` | `Cursor`: page-table well-formedness, balanced map/unmap/map_kernel/map_io, user-visible leaves are insensitive frames (Inv. 4 + 5), and a refused map returns the offered frame rather than dropping it (REF-CONSERVE) |
| `slopos_ostd::task` ownership core **LOGIC** | `proofs/task_ownership.rs` | Task ownership: the existence reference is flag-elected and parked/released at most once (T1), container transitions conserve the strong count (T2), registered ⟺ holds its existence reference (T3), no use-after-free (T4), exactly one winner of the 1→0 release with destruction exactly once (T5), a reap never fires on a dispatch-pinned task (T6), destruction implies full detachment (T7) |
| `slopos_ring` index/state-machine **LOGIC** | `proofs/ring_cursor.rs` + `proofs/ring_layout.rs` | SlopRing cursors: CQ no-overwrite, CQ-full correctness, overflow monotone-latch, cq_tail advance-exactly-one, in-flight cap, submit/consume bound; masked SQE/CQE indices in bounds + `locate` no-OOB/no-straddle |
| `slopos_net::tcp` zero-copy send queue **LOGIC** | `proofs/tcp_zc_pin.rs` | TCP `MSG_ZEROCOPY` pin lifetime: every (re)transmit reads in-bounds of its pin (INV-TCPZC-PIN-IN-BOUNDS); a pin is held across retransmits and freed only on cumulative ACK / teardown, never mid-DMA (INV-TCPZC-HELD-UNTIL-ACK) |
| `slopos_ostd::authority` capability **LOGIC** | `proofs/authority.rs` | Authority: only a program load raises a task's mask (S1); exec is `grant(image) & caps`, so no capability survives that the image does not earn *and* the task did not hold (S2); a spawn confers the image's grant only to a spawner holding `Launch` (S3); reduction is total and idempotent with no error a caller can ignore (S4) |

### Audited only

All other `unsafe`-carrying OSTD modules — the load-bearing remainder.
Reviewed against the invariants, KernMiri-covered, but **not**
machine-checked. Full-OSTD Verus verification is out of scope; critical-path
verification gets the bulk of the credibility for a fraction of the cost.

`arch` · `boot` · `cpu` · `dma` · `io` · `irq` · `sync` · `user` ·
`util` · the `mm` remainder (`frame_alloc`, `heap`, `hhdm_bytes`, `io_mem`,
`page_table`, `phys`, `tlb`, `uframe`) · `acpi` · `dev` · `ffi` · `pci` ·
and the top-level support modules carrying contained `unsafe` (`memory`,
`string`, `ring_buffer`, `bitmap`, `atomic_bitmap`, `stacktrace`,
`panic_recovery`, `early_console`).

The Phase-3G SlopRing accessor (`mm::uframe::{load_u32_acquire,
store_u32_release, copy_out_volatile, copy_in_volatile}`) is the only new
OSTD `unsafe` added since the proofs landed: ~6 lines of `read_volatile`/
`write_volatile` + acquire/release fences, each with a `// SAFETY:` note
naming Inv. 4/5, KernMiri-covered (`tests/uframe_round_trip.rs`). The
`ring/` kernel crate that consumes it is `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` and so
needs no audit — it reaches ring memory only through this verified-by-Miri
byte-copy surface (AD-3 / Inv. 4/5). The Phase-7 SlopRing proofs
(`proofs/ring_cursor.rs`, `proofs/ring_layout.rs`) machine-check the ring's
index/state-machine **logic only** (cursor bounds, overflow accounting,
in-flight cap, in-bounds masking); the four `mm::uframe` accessors above and
the release/acquire memory-ordering protocol they sit on top of **remain
audited-only / KernMiri-covered, NOT machine-checked** — Verus has no
weak-memory model, so that boundary is excluded from the proof rather than
verified.

### Unaudited

Pure safe Rust within OSTD — no `unsafe`, no Inv. obligation, sound by the
type system: `handle` (generation-counter `Handle<T>`/`HandleTable<T>`),
`process::quota` (the account arena and the `Charge`/`Reservation` tokens),
the POD/zeroable markers, boot-handoff data types, and the safe helper
modules (`bitmap_slice`, `numfmt`, `wl_currency`, `kdiag`, `klog`,
`test_support`).

`process::quota` is classified here rather than under *verified* even though
`proofs/resource_ledger.rs` machine-checks its state machine, for the same
reason `slopos_ring` carries its caveat: the proof covers the **accounting
logic only**. What it does not reach, and what is audited instead:

- The `fetch_add`/`fetch_sub` ordering on each account row, and the ordering
  between a refund and the slot release it may race. Verus has no weak-memory
  model. Each modelled `Step` is atomic; the real `charge_row` and
  `release_row` are compare-exchange loops, so the proof is the sequential
  skeleton of the concurrency claim rather than the whole of it. Covered by
  KernMiri under both Stacked and Tree Borrows.
- What `account_release` does with a row that still has live children. The
  model's `SubAccountDrop` has no children and moves nothing; the tree hands
  the released row's children to its parent and gives back only its own
  share — its `used` less theirs — so their later refunds still find what
  they charged. That arithmetic is held by the two host tests beside
  `account_release` in `arena.rs` and by the audit's `AncestorUnderCount`,
  not by Verus.
- That a `Charge` lives in exactly one field for exactly its object's
  lifetime. That is a syntactic property of the tree, enforced by
  `scripts/check_charge_linearity.sh`, not a property of the state machine.
- That `used` matches physical reality. A linear token guarantees the *token*
  is unique, never that the resource it names is; the in-kernel `quotacheck`
  audit (`ledger_audit`) is the runtime cross-check, and there is no third
  line of defence.
- That `VmaMap`'s incrementally-maintained span still describes its tree. L6
  proves `settle` is idempotent and shrink-only over an *abstract* target;
  that the target equals what the region map actually holds is checked at
  runtime by the `PagesMismatch` arm of the audit, and in debug builds by the
  assertion `insert` carries.
- Reclaim's *timing*. L6 covers reclaim as a refund bounded by the charge, so
  it cannot manufacture headroom. What it does not model is the `try_lock`
  the ext2 reclaimer takes: whether declining to block is enough to keep the
  reclaim path free of the deadlock its own allocation failure could cause is
  a lock-order argument, checked by lockdep and by
  `scripts/check_lockdep_headroom.sh`, not by Verus.

## The soundness invariants

Every `// SAFETY:` comment and the whole *audited only* classification are
written in this vocabulary, so it belongs somewhere readable rather than in
the reader's head. The numbering follows Asterinas's ATC '25 §4.3, which
SlopOS's framekernel structure is taken from; what each one means *in this
tree* is:

| | Invariant |
|---|---|
| **Inv. 1** | A frame slot is never handed out while already live, and its refcount tracks exactly the live handles. |
| **Inv. 2** | Userland cannot forge privileged CPU state. `UserContext` masks every flag or register field that would let a user task step outside its sandbox. |
| **Inv. 3** | An `asm!` block's operand widths and clobbers match the instruction it names. |
| **Inv. 4** | Page-table walks stay well-formed: every present entry names a real table or frame, and map/unmap are balanced. |
| **Inv. 5** | A user-visible leaf mapping only ever names an insensitive frame — never kernel-sensitive memory. |
| **Inv. 5'** | No stack frame exceeds 2 KiB. Enforced by `check_stack_sizes.sh` against the final ELF of every build variant, each against its own measured allowlist, with a second ceiling at the 4 KiB guard page that no allowlist can raise. |
| **Inv. 6** | A DMA or IOMMU mapping is only used through the handle that created it, for as long as the device may still read it. |
| **Inv. 7** | Only I/O ports the platform has marked insensitive are reachable, and only through `IoPortRegistry`. |
| **Inv. 8** | The calling CPU is the sole accessor of the task state it touches. |
| **Inv. 9** | A slab slot cannot outlive the slab it came from; an outstanding cell pins its page. |
| **Inv. 10** | A slab slot is only ever used for a type that fits its size class. |

## What is enforced, and by what

`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` on every kernel crate is necessary but not
sufficient. rustc drops any `unsafe_code` diagnostic whose primary span
satisfies `in_external_macro`, and `UNSAFE_CODE` does not declare
`report_in_external_macro` — so a macro defined in another crate expands
`unsafe` into a forbid crate with zero diagnostics, and the call site holds
no keyword for a source scan to find. `--force-warn unsafe_code` does not
change this; it fires in the defining crate and stays silent at the call
site. Asterinas has the same hole at larger scale and its ATC '25 paper
names no enforcement mechanism at all.

Three gates carry the claim between them:

- `check_unsafe_outside_ostd.sh` — no `unsafe` keyword is *authored* outside
  `slopos-ostd`, and every crate in the kernel binary's dependency closure
  carries the lint attribute.
- `check_unsafe_expansion.sh` — no `unsafe` *reaches the compiler* in a
  kernel crate beyond an allowlisted `unsafe impl`, `link_section` or
  `no_mangle`, each with a recorded reason. Run over each crate's feature
  configurations, because the ~2 700 `stest!` registrations live behind
  test features.
- `check_registry_sections.sh` — `kernel.elf` holds only the sections
  `link.ld` declares, each registry a whole number of entries. This is the
  only gate that sees a *dependency's* `link_section`.

## Trusted surface

The honest measure is not how many times the keyword appears — folding
`unsafe` behind a sound safe wrapper is the framekernel design, not an
evasion. It is how much of OSTD's exported API has to be trusted by reading:

| Surface | Count |
|---|---:|
| `pub unsafe fn` | 54 |
| `pub unsafe trait` | 15 |
| safe `pub fn` carrying a `# Safety` section | 0 |

The last row is the one that matters most and the one being driven down:
a `# Safety` section on a function that is not `unsafe fn` is a written
admission that a safe caller can break it. `check_safe_contract_surface.sh`
ratchets it.

`scripts/tcb_ratio.sh` reports 0.52 % unsafe-line density over the kernel
binary's dependency closure. Read it as a trend. It is **not** comparable to
the TCB fractions other projects publish: Asterinas's ~14 % is LCS over
post-LTO linked code including its dependency closure, while this
denominator is raw first-party LoC — and 41 kLoC of it is the vendored DWARF
reader, which contributes 20 unsafe lines.

## Vendored annexes

`vendor/unwinding` (3 308 LoC, 177 unsafe) and `vendor/gimli` (41 494 LoC,
20 unsafe) link into `kernel.elf` and are exempt from every source gate.
They are trusted code that is neither verified nor audited here; their
integrity rests on `check_vendor_pin.sh`, which pins each to an upstream
commit and a content hash. Both are counted in the TCB ratio's numerator
and denominator.
