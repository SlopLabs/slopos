// Task ownership proof.
//
// A Verus-annotated mirror of the ownership core of SlopOS's task lifetime:
// `slopos_ostd::task::placement`, `KArc`'s deferred strong-release split
// (`release_deferrable` / `destroy_deferred`), `task_reclaim`'s `task_put` and
// graveyard, and `task_table::{register_task, reap_task_registration}`. It
// machine-checks seven ownership obligations:
//
//   (T1) The existence reference is handed out at most once and taken back at
//        most once, elected by the FLAG CAS and never by a count. The retain
//        precedes the claim, so a releaser observing the flag is guaranteed the
//        count it is about to take back already exists.
//   (T2) Container transitions conserve the strong count: retain/leak and their
//        matching reclaim MOVE one reference between ledgers, a clone mints
//        exactly one. Linked implies owned.
//   (T3) A task is registered if and only if it holds its existence reference,
//        which is what lets the registry hold only `KWeak` and makes a lookup a
//        liveness-checked upgrade rather than a fabricated strong reference.
//   (T4) A referenced task's body is live: `strong > 0` implies the
//        destructor has not run.
//   (T5) Exactly one caller wins the one-to-zero strong transition and uniquely
//        owns the allocation, and destruction runs exactly once. Finality is
//        decided BY THE DECREMENT, never by reading the count first.
//   (T6) A reap never fires on a dispatch-pinned task: a task some CPU is
//        executing, names as its `PCR.current_task`, or holds in its idle slot
//        stays in the registry and keeps its existence reference.
//   (T7) Destruction implies full detachment: a destroyed task is
//        unregistered, unpinned, in no container, and holds no existence
//        reference.
//
// Concept borrowed from documented Linux behaviour: `task_struct` carries a
// self-reference taken back at release, and PREEMPT_RT forbids the final
// `put_task_struct` in atomic context.
//
// Every operation on the ownership core touches shared state only through
// atomics, so each method body is one atomic-bounded `Step` against the shared
// task and an invariant inductive over `Step` holds in every reachable state of
// every interleaving — which is the concurrency claim.
//
// ONE exception. `DispatchPin` and `DispatchUnpin` are single steps here but
// TWO writes in the tree, in different functions, with a real window between
// them (`task_set_on_cpu` and the `PCR.current_task` publication, in opposite
// orders for pin and unpin). Modelling the pair as atomic is sound only because
// `pinned` mirrors `task_is_dispatch_pinned`, which is a DISJUNCTION —
// `task_on_cpu_load || task_is_current_on_any_cpu || is_idle_task` — so
// whichever write lands first another disjunct still holds and the intermediate
// state collapses onto the pre-state. It does not depend on the write order.
// Narrowing that predicate to a conjunction, or deleting a disjunct, makes T6
// stop describing the tree while THIS PROOF KEEPS VERIFYING, since the model
// never sees the intermediate state it just started admitting. `CurrentTask`
// (`slopos-ostd/src/task/cell.rs`) takes no reference count and rests on the
// `task_is_current_on_any_cpu` disjunct for the same reason.
//
// `is_idle_task` is set once by `install_idle_task` and never cleared, whereas
// `DispatchUnpin` sets `pinned: false` unconditionally — an OVER-approximation
// for idle tasks, and in the safe direction because every obligation mentioning
// `pinned` carries it in the ANTECEDENT. Do not "fix" `DispatchUnpin`: the
// unconditional `pinned: false` is what keeps the step total.
//
// TWO invariants, deliberately:
//
//   `own_inv`     — the sub-step-robust core: it survives every `Step` and also
//                   the intermediate states of a decomposed `Step`.
//   `flag_agrees` — the two biconditionals (`exist_refs == 1 <==> exist_flag`,
//                   `registered <==> exist_flag`). Inductive over `Step` given
//                   `own_inv`, but deliberately NOT sub-step robust:
//                   `register_task` inserts the registry entry before parking
//                   the reference and `reap_task_registration` releases before
//                   removing the entry, so neither biconditional holds
//                   throughout either.
//
// NOT covered, and deliberately excluded rather than assumed: the weak-memory
// ordering of the flag compare-exchange and of `refcount_release`'s CAS loop
// (Verus has no weak-memory model); the intrusive placement links and the
// provenance of the raw pointers `task_placement_leak` / `_reclaim` hand
// around; `KArc`'s saturation arm (`strong` is an unbounded `nat`, so the
// saturated-leak arm is excluded — leaking is not a memory-safety violation, so
// the exclusion is in the sound direction); the weak count and `KWeak::upgrade`;
// and `force_reap_registration`, the fixture path that bypasses the status and
// dispatch-pin gates. Those stay KernMiri-covered; see `../STATUS.md`.
//
// Where the model is *more permissive* than the tree it is deliberately so:
// `ReapAndRelease` drops `reap_task_registration`'s `TaskStatus::Terminated`
// and present-entry gates, so the step machine proves a superset of the real
// behaviours and every theorem below holds a fortiori.
