// `VmSpace::cursor` page-table proof.
//
// A Verus-annotated mirror of the page-table mutation path in
// `slopos_ostd::mm::vm_space::{VmSpace, CursorMut}`, machine-checking three
// obligations:
//
//   (WF)   Cursor operations preserve page-table well-formedness: no
//          dangling intermediate frames; every present entry points at a
//          valid lower-level table for the cursor's lifetime. (CortenMM
//          SOSP '25, Fig. 12, specialised to the SlopOS walk.)
//
//   (DIS)  Concurrent cursors over distinct address spaces do not interfere.
//
//   (REF)  Mapping a `UFrame` increments its `ref_count` exactly once;
//          unmapping decrements exactly once. Inv. 4 + Inv. 5 hold across the
//          operation.
//
//   (REF-CONSERVE)
//          A map *attempt* neither duplicates nor destroys the frame: after
//          it, exactly one of the leaf PTE and the caller owns the page.
//          `map` takes its `UFrame<M>` by value, so a refusal with no channel
//          to return it drops the frame and frees the page under a caller
//          that still holds the `PhysAddr` it passed in.
//
// Concurrency control is coarse lock-per-`VmSpace`, strictly more conservative
// than CortenMM's range-disjoint parallelism: `CursorMut<'a>` holds
// `&'a mut VmSpace`, so the borrow checker admits at most one mutating cursor
// per object, and for a space shared across CPUs the sole minter of that
// `&mut` is `PROCESS_VMS[slot]` or `KERNEL_VM_SPACE`. That the kernel master
// tables have no second writer is enforced by
// `scripts/check_kernel_pml4_writer.sh`, not by this proof.
//
// Each cursor operation is one `Step` over the abstract path PML4 -> PDPT ->
// PD -> PT -> leaf at one vaddr; the exclusive borrow serializes all mutators
// on a space, so an invariant surviving every `Step` holds for that space
// under every sequence of map/unmap/protect calls.
