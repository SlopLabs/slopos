//! Per-address-space typed page-table handle.
//!
//! `VmSpace` is the only handle to a process address space exposed by
//! OSTD: the PML4 frame is private, and the sole mutation path is a
//! [`CursorMut`] held against `&mut VmSpace`.
//!
//! The mutation path ([`CursorMut::map`], [`CursorMut::map_kernel`],
//! [`CursorMut::map_io`], [`CursorMut::unmap`], [`CursorMut::protect`])
//! is machine-checked under Verus in
//! `verification/proofs/vm_space_cursor.rs`, which proves three
//! obligations over every sequence of cursor calls:
//!
//!   * (WF) a present leaf implies its whole intermediate chain (PT, PD,
//!     PDPT) is present and valid, so no walk dereferences a dangling
//!     table;
//!   * (REF) a leaf that owns a reference holds exactly one — `map` /
//!     `map_kernel` leak exactly that one, `unmap` reclaims it, and no
//!     reference is fabricated for a `map_io` leaf that never took one;
//!   * (Inv. 4 + Inv. 5) a present *user-visible* leaf is always an
//!     insensitive frame, carried by `map`'s
//!     [`UFrame<M>`](crate::mm::uframe::UFrame) argument type and by the
//!     `!prop.user` guard on `map_kernel` / `map_io`.
//!
//! The exclusivity model has two tiers: the borrow checker gives one
//! `CursorMut` per `VmSpace` *object*, and the lock that owns a shared
//! object is the sole minter of the `&mut` — `PROCESS_VMS[slot]` per
//! process, `KERNEL_VM_SPACE` for the kernel master. See
//! `verification/STATUS.md` for the gap vs. CortenMM's fine-grained
//! per-PT-page locking.
