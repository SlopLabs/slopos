//! Wait queue primitive for blocking/waking kernel tasks: an intrusive list of
//! [`WaitNode`]s under a [`SpinLock`](super::spin::SpinLock), talking to the
//! task runtime through a one-shot-registered [`WaitQueueBackend`] because OSTD
//! cannot depend on the scheduler crate.
//!
//! Two node flavours share one list: stack-pinned ones owned by the waiter's
//! frame ([`WaitQueue::wait_event`]), and heap-owned ones reclaimed by whichever
//! side dequeues them ([`WaitQueue::enqueue_current`]).
//!
//! Producers need no fence between the condition update and `wake_*`: the
//! queue's SpinLock supplies the release-acquire pair.
//!
//! `condition()` is never evaluated under the queue lock. Doing so would pull
//! whatever data lock the closure takes into the queue's lock hierarchy and
//! AB-BA against any producer that wakes while holding that same data lock. A
//! wake landing between the consumer's unlock and its recheck is absorbed
//! instead: `set_current_runnable` cancels the committed block, and
//! `yield_blocked_task` is state-aware and returns without switching.
