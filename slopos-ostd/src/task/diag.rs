//! A racy, lock-free, allocation-free view of the running task, for fault and
//! panic paths.
//!
//! The ordinary accessors are all unavailable there: `task_find_by_id` and
//! `task_find_by_cr3` take the global registry cli-spinlock, so a fault that
//! arrives while any CPU holds it deadlocks the dump; upgrading to a `KArc`
//! risks the matching drop running the allocator-heavy destructor from inside a
//! fault handler, possibly on an IST stack; and a `&TaskInner` would assert a
//! liveness a fault path cannot honestly promise. `check_task_ownership.sh`
//! check 7 enforces the first two on `boot/src/exception.rs`, `boot/src/idt.rs`
//! and every `slopos-ostd/src/panic*` file.
//!
//! [`current_task_diag`] reads `pcr::current_task_id()` first: an invalid id
//! means the slot names no heap task — the pre-heap bootstrap stub a CPU parks
//! on, or nothing at all — so the stub is filtered out *without dereferencing
//! it*. Only then does it `read_volatile` each field it needs through a raw
//! field pointer, forming no reference and minting no handle.
//!
//! The residual hazard is that a volatile read still touches memory that could
//! in principle have been freed. What makes it acceptable: a task that is some
//! CPU's `PCR.current_task` cannot be reaped, because the reap gate declines
//! while `task_is_dispatch_pinned` holds and its second disjunct is exactly
//! "some CPU names this task as its current".
//!
//! Torn values are expected and accepted: the owning CPU may be writing these
//! fields concurrently, and every consumer is a log line or a probe bound that
//! range-checks every address it reads.
