/// Doubly linked so removal is O(1) and needs no prior decision about which
/// owner list holds it.

///
/// Its own slot so a task can be futex-parked while also owner-listed. The
/// list is unbounded by construction: the link lives in the task, so enqueue
/// allocates nothing and no fixed-capacity array can overflow and force a
/// waiter to spin instead of block.

/// strong reference was released where the allocator-heavy destructor could not

/// count is already zero and the pusher owns the allocation outright, whereas
/// every other role obeys "linked implies owned".
