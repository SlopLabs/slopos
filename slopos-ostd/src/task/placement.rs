//! Ownership hand-off between a `KArc<Task>` and a scheduler placement slot.
//!
//! The scheduler's placement containers — the per-CPU ready queue, the
//! remote-wake inbox, the deferred previous-task slot, the post-switch cleanup
//! queue, and the wait maps — hold their member task by an intrusive link (or
//! map entry) plus one strong reference *parked* as a raw pointer, and these
//! primitives are the sole sanctioned way to move a strong reference into and
//! out of such a slot. They balance one-to-one: an unmatched park inflates the
//! task's strong count forever, so the allocation never returns to the heap; a
//! double reclaim frees one reference too many.
//!
//! # The existence reference
//!
//! No container covers a blocked kernel thread, a task holding a placement
//! reservation that has not reached its queue, one registered before it is
//! published, or a forked child before it joins its parent's list. So a task
//! also owns one reference to *itself*, handed to it at registration by
//! [`task_existence_park`] and taken back exactly once, when it is reaped, by
//! [`task_existence_release`]. Linux gives `task_struct` the same
//! self-reference. Two properties follow:
//!
//! - While a task is live, every container's release is provably *not* the final
//!   one, so it stays a bare atomic decrement — safe under a lock and with
//!   interrupts disabled.
//! - A task is registered if and only if it holds this reference, so the
//!   registry can be a pure weak index and a lookup is a liveness-checked
//!   upgrade rather than a fabricated strong reference.
