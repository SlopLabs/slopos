//! Fused task lifecycle state.
//!
//! `TaskState(AtomicU64)` packs the [`TaskStatus`], [`BlockReason`], and a
//! 32-bit ABA epoch into a single 64-bit atomic, so no observer can see a
//! stale reason alongside a fresh status.
//!
//! # Layout (little-endian word, low bit first)
//!
//! ```text
//! bits  0..4    TaskStatus    (4 bits, 7 variants)
//! bits  4..12   BlockReason   (8 bits, 8 variants)
//! bits 12..14   poll          (2 bits: armed, pending — see below)
//! bits 14..16   poll_era      (2 bits, wrapping token generation)
//! bits 16..32   cpu_hint      (16 bits, currently zero — reserved for
//!                              future CPU-affinity-aware wakeup paths)
//! bits 32..64   epoch         (32 bits, ABA defence; bumped on every
//!                              wake/recycle so a stale comparator from
//!                              before the wake fails its CAS)
//! ```
//!
//! The poll bits are [`PollWaiter`](crate::sync::PollWaiter)'s; they live here
//! so arming a token and parking are one atomic each, rather than a flag plus a
//! state write that a wake could land between.
//!
//! `poll_era` is what makes the token an identity rather than a boolean.
//! `WaitQueue::wake_one` pops a node under the queue lock and delivers the wake
//! *after* releasing it; in that window the waiter can finish its poll, disarm,
//! and a fresh poll on the same task can arm. Against a single armed bit that
//! late wake marks the new poll's token and its first block returns without
//! parking, having consumed a wake it was never owed. A wake therefore carries
//! the era its registration was made under, and
//! [`poll_set_pending`](TaskState::poll_set_pending) refuses a mismatch.
