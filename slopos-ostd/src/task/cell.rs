//! Exclusive access to a task's register state, witnessed by a type.
//!
//! A published task is reachable only through `KArc<Task>`, which yields
//! `&TaskInner`, so the fields the kernel must still write after publication —
//! the saved register context, the FPU area, the user-mode round-trip slots —
//! live in [`TaskOwnCell`] and need a value proving exclusive access to write.
//!
//! A witness rather than a lock because the context-switch path runs with
//! interrupts off and must not acquire anything; exclusivity there is already a
//! fact about the CPU, and the witness makes it checkable. [`CurrentTask`] (this
//! CPU runs the task) and [`SwitchWindow`] (this CPU owns both switch endpoints'
//! dispatch references) are the only implementors — sealed, `!Send`, `!Sync`.
//!
//! [`IdleTask`] also lives here and is deliberately *not* one of them: it
//! borrows this CPU's idle task, which is usually not the task this CPU is
//! running, so it proves liveness and identity but authorises no write.
//!
//! A registered-but-unpublished task is not exclusive either — it is still
//! reachable through every registry lookup, the active-task walk, the cr3 scan,
//! the job-control handles and the diagnostic dump — so exclusive access before
//! publication comes from `KArc::get_mut` on the sole strong reference.
