//! The linear tokens: [`Reservation`] and [`Charge`].
//!
//! [`try_charge`](super::try_charge) debits the leaf account and every
//! ancestor, so a refusal can land part-way up; the partial debit is handed to
//! a `Reservation` whose `Drop` unwinds it, making rollback the same code as an
//! ordinary refund. Committing one yields a [`Charge`], which lives in exactly
//! one place for exactly the lifetime of the thing it accounts for — never
//! `Option<Charge<_>>`, and no accessor hands one back by value.
//! `scripts/check_charge_linearity.sh` is what keeps that invariant true.
