//! The account arena: one `.bss` row per process plus the kernel's root.
//!
//! Charging walks *up* a bounded chain of atomics and takes no lock at all, so
//! it cannot close a cycle with the subsystem lock a charge site holds.
//!
//! A row is named by a generation-stamped [`AccountId`], never by a counted
//! reference: a counted reference inside a [`Charge`](super::Charge) would make
//! a refund a potential heap free, and refunds happen with interrupts off,
//! under a cli-spinlock, and from a dying task's own unwind. A `.bss` row has
//! no release point, and a refund against a released row is a defined no-op.
//!
//! There is deliberately no `has_headroom(kind) -> bool`: a check-then-charge
//! split is a race by construction, and the reservation is the only observation
//! of headroom this module offers.
