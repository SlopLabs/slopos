//! The per-principal disk-block ledger.
//!
//! ext2 records no owner for a block, so there is no on-disk object to hold a
//! linear token: the charge lives in a `.bss` slot keyed by the account it was
//! made against, grown when the allocator hands a block out and shrunk when
//! one is given back. [`account_release`](super::arena::account_release)
//! releases whatever is left.
//!
//! Read the ceiling for what it is: a bound on a principal's **outstanding**
//! allocations, not a persistent disk quota. A block outlives the process that
//! allocated it and the medium does not say whose it was, so what the ceiling
//! stops is one live process taking every block above ext2's own reserve.
