//! The `Process` object: the identity a task's address space, descriptor
//! table and resource account all hang off.
//!
//! This crate sits below `mm` and `fs`, so the object carries identity only
//! and those subsystems keep their own storage, re-keyed from a recycled `u32`
//! onto [`Handle<Process>`]: a recycled id designates whichever process holds
//! it *now*, while a generation-checked handle fails closed with
//! [`HandleError`].
//!
//! The parent edge is a packed handle, not a `KArc` — an owning edge would
//! unwind a deep ancestor chain on one stack against a 2 KiB frame budget, and
//! a reaped parent resolving to [`HandleError::Stale`] is exactly what
//! "orphaned" means. Address-space and descriptor-table teardown stay behind
//! the exit latch rather than in [`Process::drop`]: CR3 must move off an
//! address space before it is destroyed, and the destroy path holds a cli-lock
//! across a cross-CPU shootdown wait, neither of which a `Drop` from an
//! arbitrary last release can refuse.
