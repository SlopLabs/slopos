//! Authority: the per-process, immutable, flat capability set.
//!
//! Every operation entry point names exactly one [`Capability`] at its
//! definition site. That value reaches the syscall table *through* the
//! handler, so the dispatcher's decision and the handler's witness read one
//! artifact and cannot diverge, and a `const` histogram over the table proves
//! the classification covers every slot.
//!
//! The claim is **no unchecked authority** — not "no ambient authority".
//! SlopOS is a Linux-ABI kernel whose syscalls take integers, so authorization
//! is a credential consulted against arguments, which is ambient by the
//! standard definition. What is new is that forgetting the check is a compile
//! error rather than a review miss.
//!
//! # Where authority does *not* live
//!
//! Where an operation names an object, authority rides on the resolved object
//! — a descriptor, a seat handle, a task reference — and not on the caller's
//! capability set. The capability axis is the residue: a slot needs a
//! capability only if its footprint is neither the caller nor an object the
//! caller already names, *and* no relation between caller and target answers
//! it. That derivation rule is what refuses a catch-all by construction: a
//! proposed `Admin` fails admission because its operations *do* name objects.
