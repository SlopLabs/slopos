//! The diagnostic console: a key, pressed on the physical console, that makes
//! the kernel say what it is doing.
//!
//! A *trigger* turns a keypress into one call to [`request`], which sets a bit
//! and raises the bottom half. A *drain* at the bottom-half point runs every
//! queued command. Commands live in a linker registry, so the crate that owns
//! a subsystem's data also owns the command that prints it, and OSTD never
//! names one. A program holding the whole-machine inspection right may queue
//! the informational ones too, through [`request_informational`].
//!
//! Trigger and drain are separate because triggers run where nothing may
//! allocate, log, or take a lock — the keyboard IRQ handler, the serial drain
//! under the per-TTY lock — while what a command wants to do (walk the task
//! registry, take the allocator's lock, emit hundreds of UART lines) is legal
//! only in ordinary task context.
//!
//! The pending set is global rather than per-CPU because [`crate::sync::bh::raise`]
//! marks only the *calling* CPU, and the CPU that took the keyboard IRQ is a
//! candidate for the wedged one; every CPU's timer tick calls
//! [`poll_from_timer`] while anything is queued.
//!
//! Every command runs at the bottom-half point, with interrupts and preemption
//! enabled, and none may assume an NMI-context tier: a *returning* NMI handler
//! must be fault-free, because the `iretq` of any fault it takes would unblock
//! NMI while it is still running, and the frame-pointer walk a backtrace needs
//! is fault-*recoverable* rather than fault-free. The all-CPU probe therefore
//! asks each CPU to describe itself from its own NMI handler rather than
//! walking a peer.
