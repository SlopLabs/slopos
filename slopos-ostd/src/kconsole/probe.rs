//! The all-CPU register probe.
//!
//! Each CPU describes itself: a peer's registers are visible only to it, and
//! its frame chain is live. The probe arms the watchdog's per-CPU disposition
//! slot and sends an NMI, reusing the lockup detector's path rather than adding
//! code that runs inside an NMI handler — a *returning* NMI handler must take
//! no fault, and every stack walker in the tree is fault-recoverable rather
//! than fault-free.
//!
//! The calling CPU is skipped: a self-NMI is the one case guaranteed to land on
//! a CPU holding the klog ticket the emitters underneath this command use.
