//! Coverage for the witness-gated task cells, from outside the crate.
//!
//! The aliasing proofs live in `slopos-ostd/src/task/cell.rs`, because they
//! must call the production `pub(crate) TaskOwnCell::get_ptr`. What this file
//! covers is the surface `sched`/`core` can reach: the witness-taking methods
//! on `TaskInner`, the only way a `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` crate writes
//! register-adjacent state after publication.
//!
//! `SwitchWindow` is the witness a host test can mint; `CurrentTask::get()` is
//! always `None` here because the PCR read short-circuits on `GS_BASE_SET`.
