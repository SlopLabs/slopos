#![feature(restricted_std)]

//! Seat exclusivity, non-transferability and virtcon fallback, exercised
//! through the real syscall entry.
//!
//! The kernel test suite cannot see any of this: under `tests=on` init exits
//! before spawning the compositor, so nothing else in the tree ever takes a
//! seat. These are the only tests that do.
