#![feature(restricted_std)]

//! A spawned program's output must reach the process that spawned it.
//!
//! `exec` replaces the program image, and everything about where that image
//! lands has to agree: the code VMA the address space records, the base the
//! loader writes segments at, and the entry point the task resumes on. When
//! those disagreed the child was created, `exec` logged a successful load, and
//! the program then produced nothing — no output, no error, no fault. Nothing
//! in the kernel log said anything was wrong, which is what made it worth a
//! test rather than a look.
