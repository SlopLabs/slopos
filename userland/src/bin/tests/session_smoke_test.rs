#![feature(restricted_std)]

//! A deterministic desktop-shaped resource population, so the quota gate has
//! something real to measure.
//!
//! Under `tests=on`, `/sbin/init` exits above the compositor, shell and
//! terminal spawns, so no automated boot otherwise holds a desktop descriptor
//! population. Asserts only that the population was built, never a number:
//! the gate file holds the peaks and `check_quota_headroom.sh` compares them.
