//! Name resolution must actually resolve.
//!
//! Everything else in the suite that touches the network dials a literal IP —
//! `curl_e2e_test` picks from a hardcoded list precisely so a resolver problem
//! cannot mask a TCP problem. That left the resolver itself untested, and a
//! `-netdev` option that pointed the guest at a nameserver SLIRP does not
//! answer on went unnoticed: every `ping`/`curl` by name timed out after nine
//! seconds while `ip a` and the whole GUI stack looked healthy.
//!
//! This test is about the *resolver*, not about any one name: it asserts a
//! lookup completes quickly and yields a routable address, which is false both
//! when no nameserver is reachable and when one is configured but never
//! replies.
//!
//! **Known-failing in a full-suite boot, and deliberately not excused.**
//! Running the kernel-phase AF_UNIX socket tests first leaves UDP DNS dead for
//! the rest of the run: `test_unix_socket_send_recv_basic` alone reproduces
//! it, the queries go out, and no reply ever reaches `udp::handle_rx` — so the
//! loss is below the UDP layer, not in the resolver's expectation check. It
//! reproduces identically on a tree from before this test existed, so it is
//! older than the resolver work and is tracked separately. `just test
//! '*dns_resolve*'` is green, which is what proves the resolver itself works.
