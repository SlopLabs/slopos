//! signalfd syscall wrapper + the signal-blocking helper a ring reactor uses.
//!
//! Together these turn signal delivery from an out-of-band `EINTR` into an
//! in-band ring/poll event: [`block_signals`] keeps the signals pending
//! (so `(pending & !blocked)` excludes them from the harvest's EINTR check)
//! while [`signalfd`] exposes them as a `POLLIN`-able fd to drain.
