//! `Send` cross-core channel. The [`Sender`] is `Send + Sync + Clone` and lives
//! on **any** thread; the [`Receiver`] is `!Send` and belongs to one reactor.
//! The shared state is an `Arc<Shared<T>>` — a `Mutex`-guarded `VecDeque<T>`
//! plus the write end of that receiver-reactor's wakeup self-pipe.
//!
//! The cross-thread wake is a self-pipe write, never a direct waker call: a
//! reactor parked in `ring_enter` is rousable only through an fd its ring polls,
//! and a sender on another core cannot touch the receiver's `!Send` `Rc` waker.
//! `send` pushes and writes one byte; the receiver's own reactor reads it in
//! `park` and fires the local waker, so the sender only ever touches `Send`
//! state.
