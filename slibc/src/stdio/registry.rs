//! The open-stream list.
//!
//! C11 §7.21.5.2 (`fflush(NULL)`) and §7.22.4.4 (`exit`) both have to name
//! every open stream, so every `FILE` is on this list, the three standard
//! streams included.
//!
//! **Two lock levels, and the list outranks the stream.** The walk takes the
//! list lock and then each stream's lock in turn; nothing takes the list lock
//! while holding a stream lock, so no cycle is expressible. The walk keeps the
//! list lock across blocking `write()` syscalls, and `fclose` unlinks *before*
//! it flushes, so no `FILE` can be freed mid-flush.
