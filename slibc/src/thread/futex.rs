//! reports why.

/// `EAGAIN` (the word changed before the kernel queued us), `EINTR` (a signal)
/// and `ETIMEDOUT` are the outcomes a retry loop is entitled to ignore — the
/// caller re-tests its own condition. Anything else means the wait cannot be
/// performed at all, and spinning on it would hide a kernel-side failure
/// behind a pegged CPU.
