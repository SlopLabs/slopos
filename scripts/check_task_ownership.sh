# Task-ownership gate — the acceptance criterion for the migration that
# replaces raw task pointers with `KArc<Task>`.
#
# A `*mut Task` is a task handle with no owner. It says nothing about
# whether the task is still alive, whether anyone else is mutating it, or
# who is responsible for tearing it down. `KArc<Task>` says all three.
# This gate is the load-bearing check that the raw form does not drift
# back in once the migration lands — the same belt-and-braces role
# scripts/check_unsafe_outside_ostd.sh plays for the OSTD boundary.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# The eight checks
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#   1. No raw task pointer in binding position — `: *mut Task`,
#      `: *const Task`, `: *mut TaskInner`, `: *const TaskInner`, and the
#      `*mut *mut Task` double-indirection. Covers fn arguments, struct
#      fields, and `let` bindings. Deliberately NOT return position
#      (`-> *mut Task`): the check is named for the binding form, and the
#      sanctioned surfaces below hand pointers *out* by design.
#
#   2. No `KernelSync<*mut Task>`. A task handle laundered through a
#      blanket Send/Sync wrapper is a task handle with no owner, with the
#      compiler's objection silenced.
#
#   3. No task handle laundered through `c_void`. This check matches the
#      *cast*, never the type: `pub type TaskEntry = extern "C"
#      fn(*mut c_void)` and `TaskInner::entry_arg: *mut c_void` carry a
#      caller-opaque payload that is not a task handle, and must not trip
#      the gate. Both halves of the laundering pair are caught:
#        3a (outbound) a `*mut Task` cast to `c_void` on one line, e.g.
#           `(task as *mut Task).cast::<c_void>()`;
#        3b (inbound)  a cast back to `Task` inside a function whose own
#           signature takes a `*mut c_void` parameter, e.g. the
#           `task_arg as *mut Task` at the top of a `*mut c_void` entry
#           shim. Without 3b the migration could satisfy 3a by keeping
#           only the receiving half of the same round trip.
#
#   4. `task_borrow` and `task_borrow_mut` are gone. This is the
#      migration's terminal criterion — the accessor layer that turns a
#      raw pointer back into a reference is what the whole exercise
#      exists to delete. No exemptions.
#
#   5. No `unsafe impl Send`/`Sync` justified by a task refcount. Flags an
#      `unsafe impl ... Send/Sync` whose preceding ~8 lines mention both a
#      refcount word and a task word. A refcount buys existence, never
#      exclusivity: holding a reference proves the allocation is still
#      there, and proves nothing at all about who may write to it.
#
#   6. No `refcnt` / `task_inc_ref` / `task_dec_ref` / `inc_ref` /
#      `dec_ref` in kernel crates. Manual refcount manipulation is what
#      `KArc` exists to make unnecessary. The page-table and frame
#      refcount domains are exempt — those count *mappings*, a different
#      lifetime domain with a different owner.
#
#   7. Panic/fault paths must not take a lock or upgrade a `KArc`.
#      `boot/src/exception.rs`, `boot/src/idt.rs`, and any
#      `slopos-ostd/src/panic*` file must not mention `task_find_by_id`,
#      `task_find_by_cr3`, `task_pointer_is_valid`, `to_owned`, or
#      `task_placement_clone`.
#
#      Rationale: those lookups all take the global `TASK_MANAGER`
#      cli-spinlock, so a fault arriving while some CPU already holds it
#      would deadlock the dump — the diagnostic path would hang the
#      machine instead of describing why it died. And a `KArc` upgrade
#      whose matching drop wins the one-to-zero race would run the
#      allocator-heavy destructor from an IST stack, where there is
#      neither the stack budget for it nor any guarantee the allocator
#      locks are free.
#
#   8. No function whose return type names a lifetime that appears in no
#      argument. Such a signature fabricates its output lifetime from
#      nothing: `'a` is chosen by the caller, so it can be any lifetime at
#      all, and two calls yield two simultaneously-live references to the
#      same place. For the `&'a mut` forms that is instant aliasing UB on
#      the second call, with no unsafe block anywhere in sight at the call
#      site.
#
#      This catches the *shape*, not a list of names — which is the whole
#      point of having it alongside check 4. Check 4 greps two identifiers,
#      so another function of the same shape could be added tomorrow and
#      check 4 would say nothing about it. No exemptions.
#
#      ## What check 8 does and does not see
#
#      It is a real parser rather than a regex: it splits a signature into
#      its generic list, argument list and return type by counting angle
#      brackets and parentheses (stepping over `->` so the arrow in a
#      `Fn(A) -> B` bound does not close a generic list), then reports a
#      declared lifetime the return type names and no argument supplies.
#      Signatures spanning several lines are joined first, because the tree
#      contains a three-line one that a line-at-a-time scan misses.
#
#      Known limits, stated rather than implied away:
#
#        - Only lifetimes declared on the function's own generic list are
#          considered. One declared on an enclosing `impl<'a>` block and
#          used in an inherent method's return type is NOT seen.
#        - A lifetime introduced by a higher-ranked bound inside the
#          argument list (`for<'x>`) is not treated as declared, which is
#          correct, but one written in the fn's own generic list purely as
#          a bound (`<'a: 'b>`) is, so an exotic bound-only lifetime could
#          in principle be reported.
#        - `'static` is excluded, being a fixed lifetime rather than a
#          parameter the caller picks.
#        - A shared receiver minting a mutable borrow is invisible, three
#          times over. `fn slot(&self) -> &mut T` carries no generic list,
#          so the predicate returns before collecting one;
#          `fn slot<T>(&self) -> &mut T` declares only a type parameter, so
#          it collects no lifetime and returns early;
#          `fn slot<'a>(&'a self) -> &'a mut T`
#          does reach the predicate and is silent because `&'a self` names
#          `'a`. All three are right about the lifetime and beside the point
#          — `&self` is `Copy`, so two calls yield two live `&mut` to one
#          place. The escalation from shared to exclusive is the defect, and
#          no rule here reads mutability. Rust-for-Linux's `Opaque<T>` omits
#          `get_mut` for this reason.
#        - Substituting `'static` for a caller-chosen `'a` hides the shape
#          rather than removing it: `'static` coerces to any shorter lifetime
#          at the call site, so the caller still ends up with a borrow of its
#          own choosing, and a second call still hands out another. It is
#          honest only when the region truly is never freed and the call truly
#          happens once, neither of which is in the signature — which is why
#          `ptr_buf::OneShotBuf` puts the once-ness in an `InitFlag` and a
#          by-value handle rather than in a `'static` return, and why the
#          net device registry hands out a `KArc` rather than a borrow.
#        - The argument scan tests whether an argument could *supply* a
#          lifetime, not merely whether it names one. Four spellings mention
#          a lifetime and supply nothing, and each is blanked out of the
#          argument text before the scan reads it: a `PhantomData<&'a ()>`
#          type argument, a bare `fn(&'a ())` type, an
#          `Fn`/`FnMut`/`FnOnce`/`AsyncFn*(&'a T)` parameter list written in
#          argument position, and an `+ 'a` outlives bound on an argument
#          type. In each of the four the callee still mints the reference
#          from a raw pointer under a lifetime the caller picked: a callable
#          bound by the sugar is higher-ranked, and a `'static` value
#          satisfies `T: 'a` for every `'a`. The sound spelling for a
#          callback is the higher-ranked one, which the `Fn(&T)` sugar gives
#          for free and an explicit `for<'a>` states — a lifetime the caller
#          cannot name is one it cannot choose.
#          Blanking is delimited by a closing bracket, so every mention that
#          survives outside one is read as constraining whether or not it
#          constrains. These spellings of the bypass are left standing:
#          a callable's return type (`_f: fn() -> &'a T`,
#          `g: impl Fn(u32) -> &'a T`); an argument head whose referent the
#          caller can obtain at `'static` (`_w: &'a ()`, `_w: &'a str`,
#          `g: &'a dyn Fn(..)`); a lifetime appearing only in a trait bound
#          written in argument position (`g: impl Into<&'a T>`,
#          `it: impl Iterator<Item = &'a T>`); and a nominal or aliased
#          wrapper with public construction (`_m: Marker<'a>` where
#          `Marker` is a pub tuple struct over `PhantomData`). Closing the
#          first needs a scan to the next comma at argument depth rather
#          than a bracket matcher; the rest need type resolution this scan
#          does not have.
#          An occurrence at an argument's head over a concrete referent
#          (`&'a Payload`) or in a nominal type whose construction the
#          caller cannot reach (`t: BspToken<'brand>`) does supply, and is
#          left alone.
#          Blanking needs a balanced bracket, so a signature truncated
#          mid-region leaves the region unblanked and reads the mention as
#          constraining — a truncation fails toward silence, never toward a
#          report.
#          The bound spellings `<'a, F: FnOnce(&'a T)>` and
#          `where F: FnOnce(&'a T)` are reported, because neither the
#          generic list nor the `where` clause is part of the argument list.
#          That rule over-reports one shape: `fn first<'a, I: IntoIterator<
#          Item = &'a u8>>(it: I) -> &'a u8` is sound — an associated-type
#          equality bound does tie `'a` to the caller's data — and is
#          reported anyway. `ret` is truncated at `where` deliberately, as a
#          false-positive guard: without it,
#          `fn f<'a, F>(x: u32, f: F) -> u32 where F: Fn(&'a u8)` would be
#          reported for a function that returns no reference at all.
#          The return type is blanked the same way, because minting a
#          `PhantomData<&'a T>` or an `fn(&'a T)` hands the caller no
#          reference either. A callable's return type survives that
#          blanking, so `-> impl Fn() -> &'a T` is still reported: what
#          such a function hands back does yield a `&'a T`.
#        - Elided lifetimes are not analysed at all. `fn f(x: &Task) -> &Foo`
#          is tied to its argument by the elision rules and is silent here,
#          which is the correct answer, but it is silent by not looking
#          rather than by checking.
#        - A signature longer than 20 lines is truncated at 20 and evaluated
#          as-is rather than skipped. A truncation that loses the `->` reads
#          as no return type and reports nothing.
#        - The shape is sound when every input the caller could present
#          again is consumed by value, because then the function cannot be
#          called twice on the same referent. std's `Box::leak<'a>(b: Self)
#          -> &'a mut T` is correct for exactly that reason: the box is moved
#          in, the allocation is deliberately never freed, and no second call
#          against it is possible. Check 8 would report it anyway —
#          distinguishing "consumed owning handle" from "re-presentable raw
#          pointer or address" needs type resolution, not a signature parse.
#          The in-tree `KBox::leak` declares no generic list of its own, so
#          the predicate returns before any of this applies, and it says
#          `&'static mut T` where std says `&'a mut T` — the substitution the
#          bullet above calls a hiding move, honest here for the same reason
#          the shape is sound: the box is gone.

#   slopos-ostd/src/task/placement.rs
#       The placement state machine. The sole sanctioned way to move a

#       Intrusive-link roles. A Treiber successor *is* a raw pointer; its

    # spellings that mention a lifetime without supplying it, the callable
    # return type that does supply, and the two bound spellings — and
    # the lookalikes that must stay silent. The negatives carry the weight
    # here — this is the check most able to produce false positives.
    # `Payload` rather than `Task` throughout, so these files exercise
    # check 8 and nothing else: a fixture that also tripped check 1 would
    # make both checks' counts uninterpretable. The predicate reads only
    # the lifetime tokens in the generic list, arguments and return type,
    # so the referent type is immaterial to what is under test.
