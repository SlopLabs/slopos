# Fail the build if any kernel crate other than slopos-ostd contains a
# bare `unsafe` block or `unsafe fn`. slopos-ostd is the kernel's
# Operating System Trusted Domain — the single crate that owns every
# line of first-party `unsafe` in the kernel. Every
# other kernel crate must compile under `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`; the
# `forbid` attribute already rejects new `unsafe` at rustc time, but
# this script is the load-bearing belt-and-braces gate that catches:
#
#   - `#[allow(unsafe_code)]` exemptions slipping in,
#   - the (very rare) macros that bypass `forbid` via attribute-form
#     `unsafe`,
#   - new crates added to the workspace that forget the lint attribute.
#
# The trusted-core carve-outs:
#   - slopos-ostd/                  the OSTD itself.
#   - vendor/unwinding/             named TCB annex: a pinned third-party
#                                   unwinder used only through OSTD's
#                                   unwind surface.
#   - vendor/gimli/                 named TCB annex: the pinned DWARF
#                                   reader consumed by vendor/unwinding.
#   - slopos-ostd-derive/           proc-macro support; emits literal
#                                   `unsafe impl Trait for T {}` token
#                                   text consumed inside OSTD. Listed
#                                   here so future drift (a new unsafe
#                                   block added elsewhere in the crate)
#                                   does *not* trip the gate, while
#                                   keeping the proc-macro's existing
#                                   output strings allowed.
#   - kernel/src/main.rs            global allocator + alloc error
#                                   handler declarations (must name
#                                   `alloc` directly; same exemption
#                                   pattern as check_alloc_dep.sh).
#
# Userland-side crates (userland, slibc, slop-protocol, appkit, editor-core) are out of
# scope. `ktesting` is not one of them: it is an unconditional dependency of
# nine kernel crates and ships in kernel.elf, so it is scanned like any other.
#
# Comment-line and `#[cfg(...)]`-gated occurrences are skipped using the
# same lookback pattern as scripts/check_alloc_dep.sh so cfg-stubs that
# compile out of the kernel build are accepted.
