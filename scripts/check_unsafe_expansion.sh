# Fail the build if a kernel crate's *expansion* contains `unsafe` that no
# source scan can see.
#
# `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` and scripts/check_unsafe_outside_ostd.sh are
# blind to the same construct: rustc drops any `unsafe_code` diagnostic
# whose primary span satisfies `in_external_macro` unless the lint declares
# `report_in_external_macro`, and `UNSAFE_CODE` does not. So a macro defined
# in another crate — OSTD's, a proc macro, or a registry dependency's — can
# expand `unsafe` into a forbid crate with zero diagnostics, and the call
# site contains no keyword for a grep to find. `--force-warn unsafe_code`
# does not defeat it either; it fires in the defining crate and stays silent
# at the call site.
#
# This gate inspects the real artifact instead, the way check_stack_sizes.sh
# and check_kernel_softfloat.sh do. It expands each kernel crate and holds
# the result to a constant, not to a recorded per-crate count: a baseline
# table would need re-recording on every legitimate change and would stop
# meaning anything the first time someone bumped it to make CI pass.
#
# The constant is:
#
#   executable unsafe            0     `unsafe {`, `unsafe fn`,
#                                      `unsafe extern`, `unsafe trait`
#   unsafe impl                  only of a trait in TRAIT_ALLOWLIST
#   #[unsafe(link_section=…)]    only a section in SECTION_ALLOWLIST
#   #[unsafe(no_mangle)]         only a symbol in SYMBOL_ALLOWLIST
#
# Compiler-emitted `unsafe` is filtered by trait path, not by guesswork.
# `#[derive(Clone, Copy)]` in one derive list emits
# `unsafe impl ::core::clone::TrivialClone`, and `#[derive(PartialEq)]` on a
# multi-variant enum with fields emits
# `_ => unsafe { ::core::intrinsics::unreachable() }`. Those two are the
# entire footprint: panic!, assert!, assert_eq!, write!, todo! and the other
# common derives inject nothing.
#
# Feature matrix: the ~2 700 `stest!` sites all sit behind a crate's test
# feature, so a default-features-only run sees none of them. Each crate is
# expanded once per feature configuration it has.
#
# `-Zunpretty=expanded` is unstable and its output format is not guaranteed.
# GOLDEN_FIXTURE below is a canary: it pins the two compiler-emitted shapes
# this script filters on, so a toolchain bump that changes them fails here
# with a clear message instead of silently making the filters over-match.
