# Build an ext2 filesystem image populated with userland binaries.
#
# Usage: build_fs_image.sh <image_path> <build_dir> [bin1] [bin2] ...
#
# Each binary is placed in /bin/<name> except 'init' which goes to /sbin/init.
# A run with no binaries builds an empty volume, which is what a scratch or
# capacity image wants.
#
# Environment:
#   FS_IMAGE_SIZE - image size (default: 32M)
#   FS_INODE_RATIO - bytes of volume per inode, passed to mkfs.ext2 -i. Unset
#                   uses the host mke2fs default (16384), i.e. ~65k inodes per
#                   GiB — enough for a checked-out tree plus a toolchain
#                   sysroot on a multi-GB volume.
#   FS_JOURNAL_SIZE - size of the metadata log at /.journal; default is 1/64 of
#                   the image, floored at 4M and capped at 64M. `0` builds no
#                   log, which makes the kernel fall back to undo-scoped
#                   operations and refuse an unclean mount.
#   FS_POPULATE_DIR - a host directory whose tree becomes the volume's root, via
#                   `mkfs.ext2 -d`. Only honoured on a fresh mkfs: a preserved
#                   image holds whatever the guest wrote and is never
#                   repopulated. The directories and files this script installs
#                   afterwards are created over that tree.
#   VERITY        - `on` (default) appends a v1 integrity trailer, which makes
#                   the kernel mount the image read-only; `rw` appends a v2
#                   trailer, which leaves the image writable (a write
#                   un-attests the blocks it touches); `off` leaves the image
#                   unverified, for images the test suite writes to.
#   PRESERVE_FS_IMAGE - `1` refreshes the binaries of an existing writable
#                   image in place instead of running mkfs, so a developer
#                   iterating on the kernel keeps whatever the guest wrote.
#                   Ignored when no image exists. When an image *does* exist
#                   and cannot be kept — damaged, left dirty by a killed boot,
#                   smaller than asked for, or carrying a write-protecting v1
#                   trailer — this script REFUSES and names the fix rather
#                   than deleting it. A larger FS_IMAGE_SIZE grows it in
#                   place. A v2 trailer is recomputed at the end of the run,
#                   so it does not block a refresh.
