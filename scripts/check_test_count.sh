# Count-regression CI guard.
#
# Boots the test ISO via `builddir/run_tests --raw`, sums the
# `KTAP\t1..N` plan lines emitted by every phase (kernel + userland), and
# fails if the total drops below the baseline.
#
# Tests sometimes get accidentally deleted by mass refactors; this guard
# turns that into a build failure rather than a silent regression.
#
# Override the baseline via the TEST_COUNT_BASELINE env var. Bump it in
# the same commit that intentionally adds tests; do NOT lower it without
# explaining why in the commit message.
#
# Usage:
#     scripts/check_test_count.sh
#     scripts/check_test_count.sh --log captured-raw.log
#     TEST_COUNT_BASELINE=2500 scripts/check_test_count.sh
#
# `--log` parses a capture instead of booting, so CI can take one raw run and
# feed it to every boot-based ratchet rather than paying for a QEMU boot each.
