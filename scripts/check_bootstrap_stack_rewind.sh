# Single-writer gate for the BSP's SafeStack bootstrap data-stack pointer.
#
# The BSP runs the entire boot call chain — `kernel_main` through
# `boot_init_run_phase` and every init step — on `BOOTSTRAP_UNSAFE_STACK`.
# Its allocation pointer lives in `BSP_BOOTSTRAP_TASK.unsafe_stack_sp`, seeded
# once by `boot/limine_entry.s` and thereafter *decremented* by each
# instrumented prologue and restored by the matching epilogue. That slot is a
# live stack pointer, not a configuration value.
#
# Storing the buffer *top* back into it re-hands the span of every live caller
# frame to the allocator. The frames opened afterwards are laid over the frames
# still owned by the callers, and the first caller to read a clobbered local
# takes the consequence. That shipped: `init_bootstrap_tasks`, called from
# `smp_init` at drivers-phase priority 45, re-seeded the BSP slot while
# `boot_init_run_phase` held ~0x950 bytes below the top. Its `ordered[64]`
# array of `&BootInitStep` was overwritten with lockdep `HeldLock` records, and
# the indirect `call *0x10(%r15)` dispatched through a `poison_fn` field —
# #GP(0) on a non-canonical target, two steps into the drivers phase.
#
# Why a gate rather than a kernel test: in the dev and tests builds
# `init_bootstrap_tasks` is *itself* SafeStack-instrumented, so its own
# epilogue restores the slot and the store is invisible. In the release build
# it has no such frame and the store persists. A `just test` run therefore
# cannot observe this bug at all — only the shipped ELF can, which is why the
# fault reproduced on real hardware and never in the test suite.
#
# The check is a name-and-target check on the disassembly: no store to
# `BSP_BOOTSTRAP_TASK` may originate anywhere but the boot trampoline, which is
# hand-written assembly and holds no Rust symbol.

# Usage:
#     scripts/check_bootstrap_stack_rewind.sh --variant release builddir/kernel-release.elf
