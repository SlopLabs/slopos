# Resource-account headroom ratchet.
#
# Boots the test ISO, parses every
#   QUOTA[<phase>]: mode=M slot=S kind=K used=U peak=P limit=L denials=D
# line, and fails if a required phase is missing, if a peak exceeds its
# recorded cap, or if a denial was recorded where the gate expects none.
#
# A denial is a finding, with one exception the gate file has to name: a kind
# whose *refusal* is a tested property. `commitpages` is the machine's commit
# ceiling, and the suite proves it refuses at `mmap` and at `fork` by asking
# for more than the machine has, so the root row records those refusals. An
# `expect-denials <phase> <kind> <n>` line holds such a kind to exactly `n`,
# in both directions -- a refusal that stopped happening and an undeclared one
# that joined it both fail -- and is refused for any kind not in
# `REFUSAL_TESTED_KINDS`, so an accidental denial elsewhere stays a finding.
#
# The numbers here are **measured, never chosen**. Deriving an enforced runtime
# default from a boot-time observation is how Linux shipped limits that could
# not subsequently be raised, so there are deliberately two numbers per kind in
# two places: the enforced default lives in the kernel, and the gate ceiling
# lives here. This file is the second one.
#
# `peak` and not `used`: a dump-time `used` samples whatever happens to be live
# at that instant, which is not the high-water mark a ceiling has to be derived
# from. A peak of zero therefore fails — it means the kind was never exercised,
# and a cap set from it would be a cap on nothing.
