# Keep the resource-accounting token linear in practice.
#
# `Charge<A>` has a `Drop` that refunds, is not `Clone`, and can only be minted
# by consuming a `Reservation`. That gives unforgeability and no-double-refund
# for free. What it does NOT give is linearity: Rust is affine, so a value's
# destructor can be skipped by entirely safe code.
#
# That escape is live in this tree, not hypothetical. `drivers/src/irq.rs:57-58`
# and `drivers/src/touchpad/mod.rs:283-284` each call `core::mem::forget` twice,
# inside a `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` crate. Nothing stops the same call being
# written against a charge-bearing value, and the effect would be a row that is
# permanently short and a principal that is permanently denied.
#
# So the invariant is narrower than "a missing refund is unrepresentable",
# which would be false and must not be claimed anywhere:
#
#     A `Charge` lives in exactly one place for exactly the lifetime of the
#     thing it accounts for.
#
# This gate is what keeps that true. Five checks, each naming a specific way
# the token could be separated from the object it accounts for:
#
#   forget       mem::forget / ManuallyDrop / .leak() applied to a
#                charge-bearing binding
#   optional     an `Option<Charge<_>>` field \u2014 `Option::take` is a safe
#                separation, so the empty state must be a distinct type
#   take         `.take()` on a field whose name says it holds a charge
#   escape       a non-mint `fn` returning `Charge<_>` by value
#   clone        a `#[derive(...)]` carrying Clone/Copy on a charge-bearing
#                struct
