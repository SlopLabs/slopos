//! The filesystem's per-inode page set, as `mm` sees it.
//!
//! A shared file mapping's pages are owned by `slopos_fs`, and `fs` depends on
//! `mm`, so the dependency is inverted through a `&'static dyn` registered
//! from boot — the shape `fileio_register_tty_ops` already uses.
//!
//! Both operations are counted in *pages*, not mappings: a partial `munmap`
//! splits a VMA and hands back only the carved range, so a per-VMA count could
//! not be decremented correctly.
