//! TLB quiesce epochs — a frame is not reused until every CPU has invalidated.
//!
//! The obligation is discharged at free time, not allocation time: `alloc` is
//! reachable from page-fault handlers and from inside interrupt-disabling
//! locks, where a CPU cannot service the IPI the allocating CPU would wait for.
//! Nothing here ever waits on a peer; a wedged one grows the quarantine and, in
//! the limit, fails an allocation.
//!
//! A CPU *acks* an epoch by doing a local all-context invalidation and
//! publishing the epoch it flushed at; all online CPUs acked ⇒ the epoch
//! advances.
//!
//! A frame freed during epoch `E` is safe at `E + 2`, not `E + 1`: acking `E`
//! proves nothing, because a CPU may have acked early, *before* the unmap. Only
//! acks of `E + 1` are ordered after the advance to `E + 1`, which is itself
//! ordered after the free's read of `E`.
//!
//! Advancing is demand-driven, not periodic — an ack costs the full local TLB,
//! so it is amortised over a batch ([`request_advance`]) with a slow tick
//! backstop for an idle system.
