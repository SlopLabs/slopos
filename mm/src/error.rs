//! Unified error types for the memory management subsystem.
//!
//! This module consolidates error types that were previously scattered across
//! `paging/error.rs`, `cow.rs`, and `demand.rs`. Those modules had significant
//! variant overlap (AllocationFailed, MappingFailed, InvalidAddress, NullPageDir
//! appeared in 2-3 of them).
//!
//! Domain-specific error types (`ElfError`, `UserPtrError`) remain in their own
//! modules — they have no overlapping variants and are well-contained.
