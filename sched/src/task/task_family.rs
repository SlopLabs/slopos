//! Parent/child task ownership.
//!
//! A parent owns each of its children — live and zombie — through the intrusive
//! `children` list, as one strong reference parked exactly like ready-queue
//! placement: linking pairs a push with [`task_placement_retain`], unlinking
//! pairs a removal with [`TaskRef::from_placement`]. A zombie is a dead child
//! still parked in that list. The child→parent direction stays a plain id
//! (`parent_task_id`) resolved through the registry, the single liveness index.
//!
//! Every list mutation runs under the registry lock ([`with_task_manager`]); the
//! intrusive ops and the strong-count park/reclaim allocate nothing, so these
//! helpers hand the reclaimed guard back for an off-lock drop. That drop is
//! never final while the child is live: a task holds its own existence reference
//! from registration until it is reaped.
