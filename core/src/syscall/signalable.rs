//! `Signalable` — a signal target, resolved once and authorized in the same
//! step.
//!
//! A bare witness proves only that *a* check ran, not that it named this
//! target. The retired `terminate_task` call was the counterexample: it checked
//! the compositor bit and then terminated any id, and a `&Cap<ProcSignal>`
//! would have left it byte-identical. So the witness carries the object —
//! acting is a method on the target, and there is no other way to name one.
