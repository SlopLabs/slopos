//! Program-identity privilege grants.
//!
//! `task.flags` is the whole of SlopOS's privilege model. The privileged bits
//! come from a fixed table keyed on the program's path, applied by
//! [`spawn_program_with_attrs`](super::spawn_program_with_attrs) *after* the
//! syscall boundary stripped every privileged bit the caller asked for: that
//! boundary is purely subtractive — it can reject or strip, never confer.
//!
//! `SYSTEM` deliberately appears nowhere below; naming `/sbin/init` here would
//! let any task re-spawn it and inherit console administration.
//!
//! This is containment, not a privilege model: it is only as strong as write
//! protection on `/bin`, which SlopOS does not have.
